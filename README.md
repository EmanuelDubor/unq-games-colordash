# gdx-scala-demo
Simple initial setup for a gdx project which uses gradle and scala.

This project uses Scala only for the `:core` project only because that's less drift from the default setup.

## setup
Create a 'local.properties' which sets 'sdk.dir' to the path of your Android sdk.
*For some reason on windows I can't make this work*

Example: `sdk.dir=/opt/android/sdk`

## android
Things should just work. If not, let's learn why and update this repo! :)

## iOS
I don't have an iDevice and so far my experience getting something running in the simulator has been fruitless. Any contribution here appreciated.
